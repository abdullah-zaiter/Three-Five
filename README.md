# Three Five
This program prints the numbers from 1 to the desired value. But for multiples of three print “Three” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Five”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “ThreeFive”. 

### Run the script 
Just execute the following:  
```commandline
python threefive.py INPUT_NUMBER
```
Or without providing an input (input will be considered 100):  
```commandline
python threefive.py
```
